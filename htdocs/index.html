<h1>Tiny HTTPd's tiny homepage</h1>

<p><code>tinyhttpd</code> is a very simple webserver. It is not for
production use; instead it is primarily for a learning tool for
persons investigating the http protocol and UNIX system calls.</p>

<p>Despite its simple nature, <code>tinyhttpd</code> supports
threading and CGI scripts! For more information, see the
accompanying README file and the code itself.</p>

<p>tinyhttpd is tested on Sparc Solaris and will probably not run
on other operating systems as-is. However, commenting out the line
that does threading may be all that is required to port it. I would
like to <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/">
autoconfiscate</a> tinyhttpd at some point in time to help make it
more portable.</p>

<p>There is no downloadable release of tinyhttpd, yet. Until then,
you can get it by anonymous CVS.</p>

<p>The real homepage for tinyhttpd is the <a href= 
"http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyhttpd/">project page</a> <a
